👋 About Me:

I am an aspiring Semiconductor and Quantum Engineer with an MSc in Nanotechnology from KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Sweden) specialized in nano/microfabrication.
I work at the intersection of quantum technologies, semiconductor devices, and nanoscale engineering, with a strong emphasis on fundamentals. 
My GitHub serves as a hands-on learning space where I translate theory into code, simulations, and progressively more complex systems.

🔭 What I’m Currently Working On!

Building a solid foundation in Quantum Computing, Python, and core mathematical principles.
Designing and simulating basic quantum circuits and algorithms using Q#.
Laying the groundwork for Quantum Full-Stack development with a hardware-aware mindset.

🛠 Tools & Technologies:

Q# for quantum programming and circuit simulation
Python for upcoming scientific and quantum workflows
Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration
Semiconductor simulation and modeling tools (planned)
